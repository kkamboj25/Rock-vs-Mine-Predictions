# Rock-vs-Mine-Predictions
This is the description of the readme file.
Suppose a war is going on on waters and there is a submarine which predicts that the object beneath it is a mine or a rock. Hence to predict any object the submarine uses sonar to send sound signals and receives it back. So this signal is processed to predict whether an object is a mine or just a rock. 

The code to predict whether a rock or a mine using SONAR dataset is done in Google Colaboratory using Python. Libraries used are pandas, numpy and sklearn and the Logistic Regression Model for prediction.
